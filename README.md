# Data Science Specialization
The Data Science Specialization covers the concepts and tools for an
entire data science pipeline. Successful participants learn how to use
the tools of the trade, think analytically about complex problems,
manage large data sets, deploy statistical principles, create
visualizations, build and evaluate machine learning algorithms, publish
reproducible analyses, and develop data products. 

The Capstone is separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills  developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are: 
- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product
